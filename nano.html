  <p>The Tata Nano is a compact city car that was manufactured and marketed by Indian automaker Tata Motors over a single generation, primarily in India, as an inexpensive rear-engined hatchback intended to appeal to current riders of motorcycles and scooters — with a launch price of ₹1,00,000 or US$2,500 on 10 January 2008 ...
  <p>Tata Nano satisfies basic safety features needed from a hatchback. Infact it exceeds that in terms of build quality with high strength of body frame and metals used. It does not have advanced safety features like airbags, ABS and others.
